# TodoList (using functional views)

This is a demonstration of functional views in Django. Clone the project and follow the next steps:

## Create virtual environment

On a Bash shell, move to the folder where manage.py is located and create a virtual environment called env

```  python -m venv env ```

## Create a .env file

In the root, there is a file named envsample. Rename it to .env and populate it with your values. For development and testing, you only need the first SECRET_KEY and the ALLOWED_HOSTS values

## Activate the virtual environment

```  source envv/Scripts/activate ```

## Install the requirements

``` pip install -r requirements/development.txt ```

In case you want to run the tests, you have to install the necessary requirements

``` pip install -r requirements/testing.txt ```

## Set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE variable


``` export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="todolist.settings.development" ```

In case you want to run the tests, you have to set the variable as:

``` export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="todolist.settings.testing" ```

## Create the superuser

``` python manage.py createsuperuser ```

providing the credentials you want.

## Run the app locally

``` python manage.py runsurver ```
